# INVOICE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Imagine you have a laptop, and you sell it to your friends. When your friends buy laptop from you, you want to tell them how much they need to pay you. That's where an invoice comes in!

An invoice is like a special note or paper you give to your friends when they buy goods from you. It tells them how many laptops they had, how much each laptop costs, and how much they need to pay you in total.

So this project allows one to generate invoices into pdf that can be handed over to your client. It will show you all the invoices you have in the system after logging in. You will also be able to search the invoices by invoice number, amount and customer name. You will also be able to add new invoices into the system.

My knonwledge in this project was powered by the help of http://arbcoms.com/invoice-management-system/
